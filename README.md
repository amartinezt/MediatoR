# TaskBoard

**TaskBoard** is a modular and scalable .NET Web API designed using the principles of **Clean Architecture** and powered by the **Mediator pattern** via [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).  
It provides a base framework for task management APIs with clear separation of concerns.

## üß± Architecture

This solution follows **Clean Architecture** with the following layers:

- **API Layer** (`TaskBoard.API`)  
  Exposes HTTP endpoints via controllers. Includes Swagger UI, custom middleware, and dependency injection configuration.

- **Application Layer** (`TaskBoard.Application`)  
  Contains CQRS logic with **Commands** and **Queries** handled by MediatR. Also includes response models.

- **Domain Layer** (`TaskBoard.Domain`)  
  Defines core domain models and interfaces, remaining independent of any infrastructure or application logic.

- **Infrastructure Layer** (`TaskBoard.Infrastructure`)  
  Contains database context (Entity Framework Core), migrations, and repository implementations.

- **Test Layer** (`TaskBoard.Tests`)  
  Placeholder for unit and integration tests.
